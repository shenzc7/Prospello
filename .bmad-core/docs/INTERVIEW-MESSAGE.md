# Interviewer Message — Assignment Brief (OKRFlow)

**Timeline:** Deliver by **Friday night (IST)**.  
**Intent:** Test both **front-end and back-end** skills.  
**Repo:** You may work in **your own GitHub repo**; interviewer may also add you to theirs (share your GitHub ID).  
**Deployment:** Deploy to **Vercel** or **Blender** and share **credentials for all roles**.

> “This is the PRD. Internally we estimate ~4 weeks for the full project.  
> You have time till Friday night to complete at your pace.  
> This is to test your front-end and back-end skills.  
> Try your level best and on Friday night, deploy it in Vercel/blender and share the credentials for all user types here.  
> You’ll be working in a repo that I’ll be creating, so share your GitHub id so that I can give you access.  
> This is given to you as an assignment. Just you and from scratch—do as much as you can by Friday.  
> There might be several modules; **at least one or two core modules** should be fully working according to the PRD.  
> Treat it as your assignment. In your own pace. The sole purpose is to check both domains.  
> Doing it in your own repo is fine—easier to deploy that way.”
